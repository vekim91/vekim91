## Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page where I feature projects I've done throughout my journey into pivoting into a career in data. My background includes 7 years in the Consumer Product Goods industry where I was part of the customer development management team, handling national key accounts. This was how i discovered and developed my inclination to data and how it leads to actionable insights that drives business results, and you'll see these in the commentaries I've written in the projects I've done in this page.
